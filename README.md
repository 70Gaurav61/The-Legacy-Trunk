# 🧳 The Legacy Trunk

> A digital family archive preserving stories, heirlooms, and memories across generations.

## 🌍 Project Overview

For the **Great Zanetti family**, the circus has always been more than an art — it’s a living heritage passed down through sawdust and starlight for over a century.  
However, as the elder members take their final bow, their treasured stories and traditions risk fading into silence.

**The Legacy Trunk** seeks to solve this challenge by building a **digital family archive** — a private and secure platform where stories, heirlooms, and memories can be recorded, preserved, and shared across generations.

By leveraging modern web technologies, AI-driven tools, and collaborative features, families can ensure their shared soul and magic live on.
